# js-todolist
 This was made with javascript. Save everything that you have to do, with the most important tasks at the top of the list, and the least important tasks at the bottom. ... And by prioritizing tasks, you plan the order in which you'll do them, so that you can tell what needs your immediate attention, and what you can leave until later.
